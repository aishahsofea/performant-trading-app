**Platform and Infrastructure**: Vercel + Supabase + Upstash for optimal Next.js integration and real-time performance [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]

- **Vercel**: Edge deployment, performance insights, bundle analysis integration
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL + real-time subscriptions for portfolio and social features
- **Upstash Redis**: High-performance caching for market data and session management

### Technology Stack Details

**Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0.4 with App Router - Built-in performance optimization features align perfectly with learning objectives [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Build Tools**:

- Turbo 1.11.0 for monorepo build optimization - Essential for Bundle Size Solar System development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Webpack 5.89.0 for JavaScript bundling via Next.js - Bundle analysis integration for Solar System visualization [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Custom monitoring - Essential for learning objectives and Core Web Vitals optimization [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Testing**:

- Vitest 1.1.0 + Testing Library 14.0.0 for component testing
- Playwright 1.40.0 for E2E testing with performance monitoring integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Deployment and Infrastructure

**IaC Tool**: Vercel CLI 32.0.0 for simplified deployment with performance insights integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for performance regression testing and bundle analysis automation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

### Architectural Patterns

**Hybrid Rendering Pattern**: Strategic Server/Client Component separation for optimal trading performance [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

**Progressive Enhancement Pattern**: Performance learning features enhance core trading without blocking functionality [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

### File Locations

Based on the repository structure, new code should be created in:

- Main application: `apps/web/`
- Performance tools: `packages/performance-tools/`
- Shared utilities: `packages/shared/`
- UI components: `packages/ui/`

### Technical Constraints

**TypeScript Version**: 5.3.3 - Essential for complex financial calculations and Bundle Size Solar System 3D interactions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Performance Budget**: Baseline thresholds must be established for the six optimization phases mentioned in the technical summary [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#technical-summary]

### Project Structure Notes

The architecture references several files that don't exist yet (coding-standards.md, source-tree.md, testing-strategy.md). These will need to be created in subsequent stories or as part of this foundation setup.

### Testing

**Testing Standards**:

- Vitest + Testing Library for component and integration testing - Fast testing aligned with performance optimization learning [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Playwright for end-to-end testing with performance monitoring integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Unified testing framework across fullstack application [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**Test File Locations**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs

**Testing Requirements**: Performance regression testing and bundle analysis automation should be integrated into CI/CD [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
