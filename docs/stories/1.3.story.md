# Story 1.3: Basic UI Framework and Deliberately Heavy Styling

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** performance optimization learner,
**I want** a trading dashboard with deliberately unoptimized assets and animations using my existing Storybook design system,
**so that** I have clear performance bottlenecks to optimize while maintaining my current design approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Extend existing Storybook design system with heavy component variants
2. Heavy animation libraries loaded upfront (Framer Motion + Lottie + custom animations)
3. Unoptimized images and icons loaded synchronously without lazy loading
4. Large web fonts loaded blocking render with no font-display optimization
5. JavaScript bundles with no tree shaking and unused dependencies
6. Large JSON data files loaded synchronously for trading dashboard
7. Synchronous API calls blocking render during data loading
8. Global styles causing excessive repaints and layout shifts

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

Story 1.2 (Authentication and User Management Infrastructure) completed successfully with comprehensive user authentication system:

- NextAuth.js configuration with JWT strategy and Google OAuth
- User profile management with trading preferences
- Drizzle ORM + Supabase PostgreSQL integration
- Protected route middleware and session management
- User-specific dashboard layout persistence

### Architecture Context

**Repository Structure**: Building on authenticated dashboard foundation

```
trading-platform/
├── apps/
│   ├── dashboard/                    # Main Next.js app (existing)
│   │   ├── src/app/                 # Authenticated routes ready
│   │   ├── src/components/ui/       # New: Heavy UI components
│   │   ├── src/styles/              # New: Multiple CSS frameworks
│   │   └── public/assets/           # New: Unoptimized images/fonts
│   └── api/                         # Future API services
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                          # Shared component library (heavy)
│   ├── auth-lib/                    # Authentication utilities (existing)
│   └── shared/                      # Common utilities and types
```

**Platform Integration**: Extends Vercel + Supabase + authentication setup

- **Vercel**: Serves heavy assets and CSS bundles
- **Supabase**: User-specific UI preferences storage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks CSS/JS bundle sizes from Story 1.1
- **User Context**: Personalized heavy UI themes per user

### Technology Stack Details

**Design System Integration**:
- Existing Storybook design system (preserved)
- Heavy component variants for performance testing
- Trading-specific components with excessive DOM elements
- Performance comparison variants in Storybook

**Animation Libraries**:
- Framer Motion for component animations
- Lottie for complex trading indicator animations
- Custom CSS animations and keyframes
- Three.js for 3D trading charts (future consideration)

**Asset Management**:
- Large uncompressed trading chart images
- Comprehensive icon libraries loaded upfront
- Multiple web font families with all weights
- No lazy loading or optimization for trading assets

**Data Loading**:
- Large JSON files with mock trading data
- Synchronous API calls blocking render
- Heavy JavaScript libraries without tree shaking
- Unoptimized data fetching patterns

### Security Requirements

**Style Security**:
- CSS injection prevention in styled-components
- Inline style sanitization
- Content Security Policy for external fonts
- User-generated content style restrictions

**Asset Security**:
- Image upload validation and scanning
- Font file integrity verification
- Animation file security checks
- External resource Content Security Policy

### Integration Points

**Existing System Integration**:
- Extends PerformanceProvider to monitor CSS/JS bundle metrics
- Integrates with user authentication for personalized themes
- Connects to dashboard layout persistence from Story 1.2
- Maintains compatibility with existing performance monitoring

**New System Dependencies**:
- Storybook component variant coordination
- Animation library integration with existing design system
- Asset loading pipeline without optimization
- Trading data synchronous loading patterns

### File Locations

Based on existing repository structure:

- **UI Components**: `apps/dashboard/src/components/ui/`
- **Style Files**: `apps/dashboard/src/styles/`
- **Assets**: `apps/dashboard/public/assets/`
- **Configuration**: `tailwind.config.js`, `next.config.js`
- **Types**: `apps/dashboard/src/types/ui.ts`
- **Component Library**: `packages/ui/`

### Technical Constraints

**Design System Compatibility**: Preserve existing Storybook design system
**Performance Impact**: Deliberate degradation for learning purposes
**Bundle Size**: Intentionally large JavaScript bundles for optimization learning
**TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing with all UI components
**User Experience**: Functional but intentionally slow due to synchronous loading

### Testing Requirements

**UI Testing**:
- Visual regression testing with Storybook component variants
- Component functionality with heavy data loads
- Animation performance testing with trading indicators
- Cross-browser compatibility with synchronous loading

**Performance Testing**:
- Bundle size monitoring and alerts
- Core Web Vitals degradation tracking
- Layout shift measurement
- Font loading impact analysis
