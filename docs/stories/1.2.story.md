## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 (Performance Monitoring Foundation) completed successfully with 7/8 acceptance criteria. WebPageTest API integration blocked due to paid subscription requirement. Existing infrastructure includes:

- Performance monitoring with PerformanceProvider
- Real-time dashboard with Core Web Vitals tracking
- DevTools automation and bundle analysis
- Development environment with performance profiling

### Architecture Context

**Repository Structure**: Builds on existing monorepo with authentication integration [Source: Story 1.1 implementation]

```

**Platform Integration**: Extends existing Vercel + Supabase + Upstash setup

- **Vercel**: Hosts authentication flows with edge optimization
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL for user data + existing performance metrics
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication provider integration
- **Upstash Redis**: Session storage and caching

### Technology Stack Details

**Authentication Framework**: NextAuth.js 4.x with Next.js 14+ App Router integration

**Database Integration**:

- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Supabase PostgreSQL for user data storage
- Integration with existing performance monitoring tables
- User-specific performance data relationships
- Type-safe database migrations and schema management

**Frontend Integration**:

- Extends existing PerformanceProvider for user context
- Integrates with current dashboard layout and components
- Maintains existing TypeScript and Tailwind CSS patterns

### Security Requirements

**Authentication Security**:

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token security with NextAuth.js
- CSRF protection for authentication forms
- Secure session management

**Data Protection**:

- User data encryption at rest
- Secure API endpoint protection
- Personal data handling compliance
- Performance data privacy by user

### Integration Points

**Existing System Integration**:

- Extends `PerformanceProvider` to include user context
- Integrates with current dashboard in `apps/dashboard/src/app/layout.tsx`
- Connects to existing performance monitoring infrastructure
- Maintains compatibility with DevTools automation and bundle analysis

**New System Dependencies**:

- NextAuth.js authentication flows
- Supabase user data schema
- User-specific performance data collection
- Protected route middleware

### File Locations

Based on existing repository structure:

- **Authentication Pages**: `apps/dashboard/src/app/auth/`
- **API Routes**: `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/auth/`
- **Auth Components**: `apps/dashboard/src/components/auth/`
- **Auth Utilities**: `packages/auth-lib/`
- **Types**: `apps/dashboard/src/types/auth.ts`
- **Database Schema**: `apps/dashboard/src/lib/db/schema.ts`
- **Database Migrations**: `apps/dashboard/migrations/`

### Technical Constraints

**NextAuth.js Version**: Compatible with Next.js 14+ App Router
**Database**: Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL via Supabase with existing performance schema
**Performance Impact**: Authentication should not degrade existing performance monitoring
**TypeScript**: Maintain existing TypeScript 5.3.3 strict configuration

### Testing Requirements

**Authentication Testing**:

- Unit tests for authentication utilities
- Integration tests for auth flows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities

**Performance Testing**:

- Ensure authentication doesn't impact existing performance metrics
- Test user-specific performance data collection
- Validate dashboard persistence performance
