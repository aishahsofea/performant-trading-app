- Mobile and desktop usage patterns for different trading scenarios

### Usability Goals

**Performance-First Usability:**

- **Perceived Performance**: Interface should feel progressively faster as optimizations are applied across phases
- **Performance Transparency**: Core Web Vitals and optimization metrics should be visible and understandable to users
- **Learning Feedback**: UI should clearly demonstrate "before/after" states during optimization phases
- **Responsive Interactions**: All user actions should provide immediate visual feedback, even during heavy processing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Interface should remain functional during performance bottlenecks and optimization phases

**Trading Efficiency:**

- **Information Density**: Display maximum relevant data without overwhelming users or degrading performance
- **Quick Decision Making**: Critical trading information should be accessible within 2 clicks and load in <500ms
- **Error Prevention**: Clear validation and confirmation for trading actions with performance-optimized feedback
- **Multi-tasking Support**: Interface should support simultaneous monitoring, analysis, and social interaction
- **Mobile Trading**: Touch-optimized interfaces for mobile trading with performance considerations

### Design Principles

1. **Performance Visibility Over Hidden Optimization** - Make performance improvements visible and learnable rather than hidden behind the scenes
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Design experiences that improve measurably with each optimization phase while maintaining core functionality
3. **Real-time Responsiveness** - Every interaction should feel immediate, with performance optimizations enhancing rather than replacing good UX patterns
4. **Collaborative Intelligence** - Social and collaborative features should feel seamless and enhance individual trading rather than distracting from it
5. **Learning-Driven Interface** - UI should teach performance concepts through visual feedback, metrics display, and optimization demonstrations

**Performance-Conscious Animation Design:** All animations should demonstrate performance optimization concepts while providing smooth, professional user experience that enhances rather than hinders trading workflows.

**Core Animation Philosophy:**

- **Purposeful Motion**: Every animation should serve a functional purpose (feedback, guidance, state indication) or educational purpose (performance demonstration)
- **Performance Teaching**: Animation quality should visibly improve across optimization phases, teaching GPU acceleration and RAF optimization
- **Professional Restraint**: Maintain trading platform credibility with subtle, efficient animations that support decision-making
- **Accessibility First**: All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion settings with educational alternatives
