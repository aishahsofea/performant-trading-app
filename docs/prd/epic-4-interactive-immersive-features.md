# Epic 4: Interactive & Immersive Features

**Epic Goal**: Implement voice control, 3D market depth visualization, and collaborative trading rooms with predictive preloading. Create sophisticated user interaction patterns that will provide advanced optimization learning opportunities in Web Workers, WebGL, and real-time collaboration performance.

**Integration Requirements**: Build complex interactive features that push browser capabilities while creating clear opportunities for advanced performance optimization techniques.

## Story 4.1: Voice-Controlled Trading Assistant with Performance Issues

As a trader,
I want voice commands to control charts and query data,
so that I can perform hands-free analysis and multitask effectively.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Web Speech API integration with continuous listening without optimization
2. Voice command processing blocking main thread during recognition
3. Large speech recognition models loaded synchronously on page load
4. Voice feedback with text-to-speech without audio buffering optimization
5. Command history and voice data stored in memory without cleanup
6. No command debouncing - processing every partial speech input
7. Voice commands triggering expensive DOM queries and manipulation
8. Audio processing causing frame drops and UI stuttering

## Story 4.2: 3D Market Depth Visualization with WebGL Performance Issues

As a trader,
I want immersive 3D visualization of order book depth,
so that I can understand market liquidity and identify trading opportunities visually.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Three.js integration creating 3D order book visualization with excessive geometry
2. Real-time depth data updates recreating entire 3D scene on each change
3. High-poly 3D models and complex shaders without level-of-detail optimization
4. Camera controls and interactions causing continuous re-renders
5. No frustum culling or occlusion culling for off-screen geometry
6. Texture loading and material updates on main thread
7. No geometry instancing for repeated visual elements
8. Memory leaks from undisposed Three.js objects and textures

## Story 4.3: Collaborative Trading Rooms with Real-Time Synchronization Issues

As a collaborative trader,
I want shared trading rooms with real-time chart annotations and user presence,
so that I can analyze markets with other traders and share insights instantly.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-user cursor tracking with high-frequency position updates
2. Real-time chart annotations without conflict resolution or optimization
3. Shared whiteboard functionality with excessive canvas redraws
4. Voice chat integration without audio optimization or bandwidth management
5. User presence indicators updating without throttling or batching
6. Chart synchronization sending full chart state on every interaction
7. No annotation bundling - individual WebSocket messages for each drawing action
8. Collaborative state management causing cascading re-renders across components

## Story 4.4: Predictive Data Preloading with Inefficient Implementation

As a performance optimization learner,
I want a system that predicts and preloads data based on user behavior,
so that I can learn advanced caching and prediction techniques while improving perceived performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User behavior tracking with excessive event collection without sampling
2. Prediction algorithms running on main thread causing UI blocking
3. Aggressive preloading strategy fetching unnecessary data and consuming bandwidth
4. No cache invalidation strategy leading to stale data and memory bloat
5. Preloading queue without prioritization or request deduplication
6. Machine learning model inference blocking UI updates
7. Prediction accuracy tracking without data aggregation or analysis optimization
8. User behavior analytics stored in memory without persistence optimization
