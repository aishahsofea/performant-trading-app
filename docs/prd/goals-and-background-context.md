# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Master web performance optimization through hands-on experience with a real-world application
- Build expertise in Application Response Speed (ARS) optimization for job interview preparation
- Create a systematic learning path through deliberate performance anti-patterns followed by strategic optimization
- Develop proficiency with Next.js performance features and modern web optimization techniques
- Build a portfolio project demonstrating measurable performance improvements

## Background Context
This project serves a dual purpose: creating a functional trading dashboard while providing a comprehensive learning platform for web performance optimization. The approach involves deliberately building an unoptimized application first, then systematically applying performance optimization techniques across six distinct phases. This methodology mirrors real-world scenarios where developers inherit poorly performing applications and must improve them incrementally.

The project directly supports preparation for a role requiring ARS optimization expertise, providing hands-on experience with Core Web Vitals, rendering optimization, bundle management, and real-time data performance challenges.
