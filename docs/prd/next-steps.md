# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"I have a comprehensive PRD for a performance learning trading dashboard. The project involves building deliberately unoptimized features first, then systematically optimizing them across 6 phases. Please create UI/UX specifications that support both the trading functionality and the performance learning objectives, with particular focus on visualizing performance improvements and creating interfaces for the 4 advanced features: heat map visualization, social trading feed, voice control, and collaborative trading rooms."

## Architect Prompt  
"I have a detailed PRD for a Next.js trading dashboard focused on performance optimization learning. The project requires building 6 epics that progress from deliberately unoptimized implementations to production-grade performance. Please create a technical architecture that supports this learning journey, with specific guidance for implementing performance anti-patterns initially and clear optimization paths for all 24 stories. Focus on Next.js 14+ features, real-time data handling, and the 4 complex features: heat map, social feed, voice control, and collaborative rooms."
