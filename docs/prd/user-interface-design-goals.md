# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a high-performance trading dashboard that transforms from a deliberately sluggish, overwhelming interface in Phase 0 to a lightning-fast, intuitive platform by Phase 6. The interface should feel progressively more responsive and intelligent as optimizations are applied, providing clear visual feedback about performance improvements to support the learning objectives.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Real-time responsiveness**: All interactions should provide immediate visual feedback, even during heavy data processing
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex features like 3D visualizations and collaborative tools should load progressively without blocking core functionality
- **Voice-first accessibility**: Voice commands should feel natural and fast, supporting hands-free trading analysis
- **Collaborative awareness**: Multiple users should feel seamlessly connected in shared trading rooms with minimal latency
- **Predictive intelligence**: Interface should anticipate user needs through learned behavior patterns

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard**: Multi-widget layout with heat map, charts, portfolio summary, and social feed
- **Trading Room**: Collaborative space with shared charts, annotations, and real-time user presence
- **3D Market Depth**: Immersive order book visualization with performance controls
- **Voice Command Center**: Visual feedback interface for speech recognition and command execution
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time Core Web Vitals dashboard showing optimization impact
- **Social Trading Hub**: Feed-based interface for following traders and sharing insights
- **Settings & Optimization**: Controls for enabling/disabling performance features for learning comparison

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout all phases, with particular attention to:
- Voice control accessibility for motor-impaired users
- High contrast modes for financial data visualization
- Keyboard navigation for all collaborative features
- Screen reader compatibility for data tables and charts

## Branding
Modern financial technology aesthetic with performance-first design philosophy:
- **Learning Theme**: Visual indicators showing "before/after" optimization states
- **Performance Branding**: Color coding for performance metrics (green = optimized, red = needs work)
- **Professional Trading**: Clean, data-dense layouts that prioritize information hierarchy
- **Gamification Elements**: Progress indicators and achievement badges for performance milestones

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Primary**: Desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) optimized for trading workflows
- **Secondary**: Tablet interfaces with touch-optimized collaborative features
- **Mobile**: Responsive design with simplified views, focusing on core trading functions and voice commands
- **Performance Testing**: All device types used for performance benchmarking across optimization phases
