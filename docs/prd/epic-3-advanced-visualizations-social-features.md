# Epic 3: Advanced Visualizations & Social Features

**Epic Goal**: Implement the heat map visualization and social trading feed features with deliberately inefficient rendering and data management patterns. Create complex UI challenges that will provide excellent learning opportunities for virtual scrolling, canvas optimization, and real-time data handling.

**Integration Requirements**: Build data visualization and social interaction capabilities that stress-test browser rendering and memory management while delivering engaging user features.

## Story 3.1: Real-Time Market Heat Map with Performance Bottlenecks

As a trader,
I want a visual heat map showing 10,000+ stock movements with real-time color updates,
so that I can quickly identify market trends and sector performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Market heat map displaying 10,000+ cells in a grid layout using DOM elements
2. Real-time color transitions on every price update without RAF optimization
3. Hover effects and tooltips causing layout thrashing and excessive repaints
4. CSS-based animations for all color changes without GPU acceleration
5. No cell virtualization - all 10,000+ cells rendered simultaneously
6. Heat map calculations performed on main thread blocking UI updates
7. No data sampling - full precision calculations for all visible cells
8. Memory leaks from event listeners not being properly cleaned up

## Story 3.2: Social Trading Feed with Infinite Scroll Performance Issues

As a trader,
I want a social feed showing trading insights and reactions from other users,
so that I can learn from community sentiment and share my own analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Infinite scroll implementation loading all historical posts into DOM
2. Real-time feed updates prepending new posts without virtual scrolling
3. Rich media content (images, videos, charts) loaded eagerly without lazy loading
4. Like/comment/share interactions causing full post component re-renders
5. User avatar and profile data fetched individually for each post
6. No feed virtualization - all loaded posts remain in DOM simultaneously
7. Real-time typing indicators and live reactions without debouncing
8. Feed sorting and filtering operations on entire dataset in memory

## Story 3.3: Live Reactions and User Presence System

As a social trader,
I want real-time reactions and user presence indicators,
so that I can engage with the community and see who's actively trading.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. WebSocket connections for real-time reactions without connection pooling
2. User presence indicators updating every second for all visible users
3. Live typing indicators and cursor positions without throttling
4. Reaction animations triggering layout recalculations
5. No batching of real-time events - individual WebSocket messages for each action
6. User activity tracking without event aggregation or sampling
7. Presence data stored in component state causing unnecessary re-renders
8. Connection management without reconnection logic or error handling

## Story 3.4: News Feed Integration with Media Loading Issues

As a trader,
I want financial news articles with images and videos integrated into my dashboard,
so that I can stay informed about market-moving events.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. News articles loaded with full-resolution images without optimization
2. Auto-playing videos in news feed without intersection observer
3. News content loaded synchronously blocking other dashboard features
4. No image lazy loading or progressive enhancement
5. News feed refresh causing complete content re-fetch and re-render
6. Search and filtering operations on entire news dataset in memory
7. News categories and tags causing duplicate API requests
8. No content caching - fresh requests for previously viewed articles
