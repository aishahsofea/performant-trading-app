# Epic 5: Performance Optimization Blitz (Phases 1-3)

**Epic Goal**: Systematically optimize rendering performance, implement code splitting and bundle optimization, and enhance network efficiency. Transform the deliberately unoptimized application into a measurably faster experience while documenting optimization techniques and their impact on Core Web Vitals.

**Integration Requirements**: Apply React performance patterns, Next.js optimization features, and modern web performance techniques while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Story 5.1: React Rendering Performance Optimization

As a performance optimization learner,
I want to implement React performance patterns to eliminate unnecessary re-renders,
so that I can improve component rendering efficiency and learn memoization techniques.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement React.memo() for expensive components with proper equality checks
2. Add useMemo() and useCallback() hooks for heavy calculations and event handlers
3. Optimize context usage to prevent cascading re-renders
4. Implement component composition patterns to reduce prop drilling
5. Add React Profiler integration to identify and fix rendering bottlenecks
6. Convert class components to functional components with proper hook usage
7. Implement virtualization for large lists (portfolio, market data, social feed)
8. Measure and document rendering performance improvements with before/after metrics

## Story 5.2: Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization

As a performance optimization learner,
I want to implement advanced code splitting and bundle optimization,
so that I can reduce initial bundle size and improve application loading performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement route-based code splitting for all major dashboard sections
2. Add dynamic imports for heavy chart libraries and 3D visualization components
3. Configure webpack bundle splitting for vendor and application code optimization
4. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components and features
5. Optimize third-party library imports with tree shaking and selective imports
6. Add bundle analysis reporting with size tracking and budget alerts
7. Implement progressive loading for complex features (voice, 3D, collaborative)
8. Achieve 60%+ bundle size reduction with performance metrics documentation

## Story 5.3: Network and Data Optimization

As a performance optimization learner,
I want to optimize data fetching and network performance,
so that I can improve application responsiveness and learn advanced caching strategies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement React Query for intelligent caching and background synchronization
2. Add request batching and deduplication for stock data API calls
3. Implement WebSocket optimization with connection pooling and message batching
4. Add service worker for offline functionality and cache management
5. Optimize API responses with data normalization and compression
6. Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns for real-time data
7. Add request prioritization and background preloading for anticipated data
8. Measure and document network performance improvements with Core Web Vitals impact

## Story 5.4: Image and Asset Optimization

As a performance optimization learner,
I want to optimize all images and static assets,
so that I can improve loading performance and learn modern asset delivery techniques.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Next.js Image component with automatic format optimization
2. Add responsive image loading with appropriate sizing and lazy loading
3. Optimize SVG icons and graphics with compression and sprite sheets
4. Implement progressive image loading with blur-up technique
5. Add CDN integration for static asset delivery optimization
6. Optimize web font loading with font-display and preload strategies
7. Implement critical CSS extraction and inline optimization
8. Measure Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) improvements with before/after documentation
