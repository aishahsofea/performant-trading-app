# Epic 1: Foundation & Performance Baseline

**Epic Goal**: Establish a Next.js 14 trading dashboard foundation with comprehensive performance monitoring infrastructure. Create deliberate performance bottlenecks while building essential project scaffolding and measurement capabilities that will enable systematic optimization learning throughout all subsequent phases.

**Integration Requirements**: Set up end-to-end performance tracking from development through deployment, ensuring all optimizations can be measured and documented.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Performance Monitoring Foundation

As a performance optimization learner,
I want a Next.js project with comprehensive performance monitoring setup,
so that I can measure and track improvements throughout my optimization journey.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project initialized with App Router and TypeScript configuration
2. Lighthouse CI integrated into development workflow with automated reporting
3. Custom Core Web Vitals tracking implemented with real-time dashboard display
4. Performance budget configuration established with baseline thresholds
5. Bundle analyzer integration for tracking JavaScript bundle sizes
6. Chrome DevTools Performance timeline automation for consistent testing
7. WebPageTest API integration for external performance validation
8. Development environment includes performance profiling tools and hot reloading

## Story 1.2: Authentication and User Management Infrastructure

As a trading dashboard user,
I want secure authentication and personalized user profiles,
so that I can save my portfolio data and trading preferences.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration and login system implemented with NextAuth.js
2. User profile management with trading preferences and portfolio settings
3. Session management with secure token handling
4. Database schema for user data created with PostgreSQL integration
5. User dashboard layout persistence and customization options
6. Password reset and email verification workflows
7. Basic authorization middleware for protected routes
8. User onboarding flow with welcome tutorial

## Story 1.3: Basic UI Framework and Deliberately Heavy Styling

As a performance optimization learner,
I want a visually rich but deliberately unoptimized UI foundation,
so that I have clear performance bottlenecks to optimize in later phases.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Tailwind CSS configured with extensive custom theme and heavy CSS bundle
2. Multiple large CSS frameworks loaded (Bootstrap + Material-UI + custom CSS)
3. Inline styles mixed with CSS-in-JS creating style duplication
4. Heavy animation libraries loaded upfront (Framer Motion + Lottie + custom animations)
5. Unoptimized images and icons loaded synchronously without lazy loading
6. Large web fonts loaded blocking render with no font-display optimization
7. Component library setup with heavy dependencies and no tree shaking
8. Global styles causing excessive repaints and layout shifts
